Comes not that blood as modest evidence
Bashful sincerity and comely love.
For thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love,
Death is the fairest cover for her shame
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death.
The practice of it lives in John the bastard,
If ever love had interest in his liver,—
The supposition of the lady’s death
And though you know my inwardness and love
I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is not that strange?
I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make him eat it
that says I love not you.
With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest I love thee.
You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to protest I loved you.
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.
I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you: nay, I
Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
